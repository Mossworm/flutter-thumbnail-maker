# ****Introduction****


This is a thumbnail maker I made to study flutter. It is a site for generating thumbnails for YouTube, blogs, etc. It is a website that allows you to set an image in the center of the screen and a surrounding background color that matches the image, and then export it as a png. Later, it will support adding text and various layouts and resolutions.
